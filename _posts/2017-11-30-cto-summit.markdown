I've got a goal for 2018 to attend four tech and leadership conferences. But before we make it to 2018 I was excited to
happen across the [2017 NASDAQ CTO Summit](https://www.ctoconnection.com/summits/ny2017) a few days before it ran. I
hustled a ticket and am going to represent [BombBomb](https://bombbomb.com) in the big city.

Last year I had a really good time attending the inaugural [Inman Hacker Connect](https://www.inman.com/2016/11/21/inman-announces-hacker-connect-a-deep-real-estate-technology-dive/).
Hacker Connect was (and *still is*) a great opportunity to meet some other tech leaders in the real estate space specifically.

Watch this space for some takeaways next week.
